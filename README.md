# Harvard CS50 Assignments

This repository contains assignments for Harvard's CS50 course. Each file corresponds to a specific programming challenge from the course. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose.

## Assignments

### DNA
**Files:**
- `dna.py`

- `databases/large.csv`
- `databases/small.csv`

- `sequences/1.txt` (plus 19 more similar text files)

**Description:**
These CSV files contain DNA sequence information for different individuals. They are used in the DNA assignment to match DNA sequences against known profiles.



**Description:**
These text files contain raw DNA sequences that are analyzed by dna.py to identify individuals based on genetic markers.

**Description:**
This program collects DNA data and matches it against a database. It reads a CSV file containing DNA sequence counts for different individuals and a text file containing an unknown DNA sequence. It then compares the sequences and determines the identity of the individual.

**Usage:**
```sh
python dna.py <csv file path> <txt file path>
```
### Credit
**Files:**
- `credit.py`

**Description:**
This program checks the validity of a credit card number using Luhn's algorithm. It determines the card type (VISA, AMEX, MASTERCARD) based on the number's structure.

### Mario
**Files:** 
- `mario.py`

**Description:**

This program generates a pyramid similar to the one in Super Mario Bros. based on user input. The height of the pyramid is requested from the user, and it prints a double-sided pyramid.

### Readability
**Files:**
- `readability.py`

**Description:**
This program determines the readability level of a given text using the Coleman-Liau index. It calculates the average number of letters and sentences per 100 words to estimate the reading grade level.
